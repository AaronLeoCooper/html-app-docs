## Direct download

The most straightforward means of installing HTMLApp is by downloading the
browser package directly from the latest release branch on GitHub:

[Download latest package](https://github.com/AaronLeoCooper/html-app/archive/master.zip)

## Via a package manager

The most popular package manager for the job will be [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com),
however [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) can also be used.

Installation via NPM is done by running this from the command line in your project
directory:

```bash
npm i html-app
```

Or via Yarn:

```bash
yarn add html-app
```
